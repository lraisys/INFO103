       "<pre style='border:solid 1px;padding:3px;margin-left:0px;background-color:LightCoral'>In a way, in our contemporary world view, it&#x27;s easy to think that science has come to take the place of God. But some philosophical problems remain as troubling as ever. Take the problem of free will. This problem has been around for a long time, since before Aristotle in 350 B.C. St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, these guys all worried about how we can be free if God already knows in advance everything you&#x27;re gonna do. Nowadays we know that the world operates according to some fundamental physical laws, and these laws govern the behavior of every object in the world. Now, these laws, because they&#x27;re so trustworthy, they enable incredible technological achievements. But look at yourself. We&#x27;re just physical systems too, right? We&#x27;re just complex arrangements of carbon molecules. We&#x27;re mostly water, and our behavior isn&#x27;t gonna be an exception to these basic physical laws. So it starts to look like whether its God setting things up in advance and knowing everything you&#x27;re gonna do or whether it&#x27;s these basic physical laws governing everything, there&#x27;s not a lot of room left for freedom.\n",
       "\n",
       "So now you might be tempted to just ignore the question, ignore the mystery of free will. Say &quot;Oh, well, it&#x27;s just an historical anecdote. It&#x27;s sophomoric. It&#x27;s a question with no answer. Just forget about it.&quot; But the question keeps staring you right in the face. You think about individuality for example, who you are. Who you are is mostly a matter of the free choices that you make. Or take responsibility. You can only be held responsible, you can only be found guilty, or you can only be admired or respected for things you did of your own free will. So the question keeps coming back, and we don&#x27;t really have a solution to it. It starts to look like all our decisions are really just a charade.\n",
       "\n",
       "Think about how it happens. There&#x27;s some electrical activity in your brain. Your neurons fire. They send a signal down into your nervous system. It passes along down into your muscle fibers. They twitch. You might, say, reach out your arm. It looks like it&#x27;s a free action on your part, but every one of those - every part of that process is actually governed by physical law, chemical laws, electrical laws, and so on.\n",
       "\n",
       "So now it just looks like the big bang set up the initial conditions, and the whole rest of human history, and even before, is really just the playing out of subatomic particles according to these basic fundamental physical laws. We think we&#x27;re special. We think we have some kind of special dignity, but that now comes under threat. I mean, that&#x27;s really challenged by this picture.\n",
       "\n",
       "So you might be saying, &quot;Well, wait a minute. What about quantum mechanics? I know enough contemporary physical theory to know it&#x27;s not really like that. It&#x27;s really a probabilistic theory. There&#x27;s room. It&#x27;s loose. It&#x27;s not deterministic.&quot; And that&#x27;s going to enable us to understand free will. But if you look at the details, it&#x27;s not really going to help because what happens is you have some very small quantum particles, and their behavior is apparently a bit random. They swerve. Their behavior is absurd in the sense that its unpredictable and we can&#x27;t understand it based on anything that came before. It just does something out of the blue, according to a probabilistic framework. But is that going to help with freedom? I mean, should our freedom be just a matter of probabilities, just some random swerving in a chaotic system? That starts to seem like it&#x27;s worse. I&#x27;d rather be a gear in a big deterministic physical machine than just some random swerving.\n",
       "\n",
       "So we can&#x27;t just ignore the problem. We have to find room in our contemporary world view for persons with all that that entails; not just bodies, but persons. And that means trying to solve the problem of freedom, finding room for choice and responsibility, and trying to understand individuality.\n",

       "A mystery series following a police chief inspector during the Second World War, it shows a lot of the hardships of war in the lens of a murder investigation. The third ever episode of the series focused on conscientious objectors - those who refused to enlist due to practicing pacifism - as well as the evacuation of children during the Blitz.\n",
       "\n",
       "When a child evacuated to the country during the Blitz was killed in an attempt on a judge&#x27;s life, Tennant&#x27;s character was one of the suspects. Despite being an open objector and living in a commune with other objectors, he expressly wanted the judge dead because the judge sentenced his friend to the front lines as part of a panel for judging if people were just trying to bail on being conscripted; while in prison awaiting shipment to boot camp, a group of cops tortured the poor sod to death with a fire hose.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the Judge is murdered, Foyle discovers that Tennant had signed up for the war. As it turns out, he expressly wanted to murder the bastard &gt;!and went to the house with an illegally-owned handgun to do it, but someone else killed the judge before he could!&lt;; he tells his friend&#x27;s wife about how much he values pacifism and the memory of his friend, but as Germany&#x27;s war crimes become more and more prevalent and since he knows he has the intent to kill, he might as well do something good with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "And in case you&#x27;re wandering, &gt;!the judge was the one who killed the child. His daughter took the evacuee against her parents&#x27; wishes but they weren&#x27;t allowed to expel the boy, who ended up witnessing the judge taking bribes to let the sons of rich folk claim the rights of conscientious objectors; he murdered the boy before the evacuation was meant to end in order to shut him up. And because of his fervent hatred of the lower classes (one of the reasons he sent *actual* objectors to die on the Front), he tried to frame his daughter&#x27;s boyfriend by planting motoring oil at the crime scene due to the boyfriend being a mechanic. Foyle figured out that the judge was responsible because of the motoring oil - the boyfriend&#x27;s being a mechanic was a cover story for his actual job as a carpenter assigned to make *thousands* of coffins.!&lt;\n",

So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life&#x27;s work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn&#x27;t tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You&#x27;ve never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I&#x27;m sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you&#x27;ve been laid a few times too. But you couldn&#x27;t tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you&#x27;ve never been in one. You&#x27;ve never held your best friend&#x27;s head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I&#x27;d get a sonnet, but you&#x27;ve never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn&#x27;t know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn&#x27;t know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term &quot;visiting hours&quot; didn&#x27;t apply to you. And you wouldn&#x27;t know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you&#x27;ve never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don&#x27;t see an intelligent confident man, I don&#x27;t see a peer, and I don&#x27;t see my equal. I see a boy.&quot;\n",

Two is when he wakes up next to uma and finds a hair on his pillow and freaks out and runs outside to the ocean shoreline, picks a good scrubbing rock and scrubs himself silly, all the while I’m thinking he just jizzed all over the place last night! How in the hell is scrubbing up in the ocean gonna erase THAT genetic material nightmare??? Lol. The third and most poignant is when he gets back to Gattaca to board his outgoing starship, is forced to pee in a cup… with his OWN pee this time, the machine fails him, but the Doctor presses another button and passes him and the Doctor tells him about his own son, then calls him by his real name and tells him to have a nice trip. At this point is when you realize the Doctor knew he was a borrowed ladder the whole movie and by inference so did the operation Director since you see the Doctor and the Director talking about Ethan’s character when he’s running on the treadmill earlier in the movie, and essentially the janitor knew too (you see more of the janitor in the cut scenes on the dvd). And don’t get me started with Jude Laws character burning himself up in the insinerator.\n",
