If a specific social media company or platform has a majority republican following or fanbase, they will push content that caters to their political views. They will post more stories that are pro-republican and possibly anti-democrat on their platform or site in order to gain more traffic and viewers. However, this might influence their bias and reliability when being measured. Some platforms or companie may ignore this information and continue to push unbiased content to their users in order to gain traffic from both political parties, this would make them less-biased and more reliable. Lastly, platforms might push or suggest specific content or articles to specific individual users based on their political views or susceptibility to conspiracy theories in order to keep that user engaged on their site.

I think that when a virtuistic individual is measuring media bias and reliability, they would focus mainly on the truthfullness and facts behind each of the urls/websites. Since virtuistic individuals value truthfulnes, honesty and other like values, they would likely measure the reliability of an article based on facts vs opinion, measuring fact based articles higher than opinion based and also have a bias towards fact based urls rather than opinion based. For my second ethics framework, I chose Egoism. An egoistic individual would have a much more biased take when measuring reliability of urls and websites becausse they would likely base their measurements on their own personal preferences, rather than the true reliability. There would be a strong bias for urls that align with their preferences and views and they would probbaly deem those as more reliable because they believe that their preferences are the \"correct\" ones. I think that an egoistic individual would have more biased information and a virtuistic individual would have more reliability."
